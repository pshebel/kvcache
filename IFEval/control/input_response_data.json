This is because legal advice can provide guidance on how to interpret the law and ensure that the individual is doing what is best for themselves and society as a whole. By following a law without consulting legal advice, one runs the risk of violating the law and potentially causing harm to others or the community at large. In contrast, by following a law that aligns with their values and beliefs, individuals have greater autonomy and control over their lives, which can lead to better outcomes for themselves and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to seek legal advice before making any decisions regarding the law. In conclusion, while it may be tempting to follow a law blindly, seeking legal advice before acting is crucial to avoid potential harm and ensure ethical decision-making.
